The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in mathematics** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all math disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate math majors, minus general education (non-math) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of math.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.
